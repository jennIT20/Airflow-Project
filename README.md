# Airflow Loan Review Project

## Description
This project implements an Airflow DAG to simulate a loan review process. It randomly generates loan predictions and determines the best loan option based on these predictions. The DAG demonstrates the use of Python and Bash operators, along with branching logic to execute different tasks based on the results.
