# Airflow Loan Review Project

## Description
This project implements an Airflow DAG to simulate a loan review process. It randomly generates loan predictions and determines the best loan option based on these predictions. The DAG demonstrates the use of Python and Bash operators, along with branching logic to execute different tasks based on the results.

## Features
- Randomized loan predictions using Python.
- Branching logic to determine the best loan option.
- Integration of Bash commands to output results.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Apache Airflow

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Airflow-Project.git
   cd Airflow-Project


Pull the Airflow Docker image:


docker pull apache/airflow:2.5.0
Set up the environment: Create an airflow directory and download the docker-compose.yaml file:


mkdir airflow
cd airflow
curl 'https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/2.1.1/docker-compose.yaml' -o docker-compose.yaml
Modify the docker-compose.yaml: Set the AIRFLOW__CORE__LOAD_EXAMPLES environment variable to false.

Start Airflow:


docker-compose up
Access Airflow: Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080. Use the default username and password: airflow.

Usage
The DAG named loan_review will run daily, generating loan predictions and determining the best loan option.
You can view the DAG in the Airflow UI and trigger it manually if desired.
