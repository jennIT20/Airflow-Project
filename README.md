# Airflow-Project
This project features an Apache Airflow DAG for evaluating loan applications. It generates random prediction scores for three loans, determining the best option based on these scores. The outcome is classified as "good" (score > 8) or "bad" (score â‰¤ 8), demonstrating Airflow's automation capabilities in decision-making workflows.
